                    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Damien</strong>, I'm 21 years old and I'm excited to tell you some interesting stuff about myself! Ill start with my hobbies / interests!</p>
                    <p>I've done many things over the last few years but only some of them have stuck with me, some longer than others. My <strong>top three</strong> hobbies would have to be:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Playing Video Games</li>
                        <li>Driving</li>
                        <li>Coding</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>These hobbies are very important to me, i've spent thousands of hours on each of them and I continue to improve! As much as I like doing those, I still have some more things I like to do when I have the time. Some other interests that I have include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bug Keeping</li>
                        <li>Terrarium Building</li>
                        <li>Decorating</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you want more information on these things go to the Biography tab and checkout the related text files.</p>
