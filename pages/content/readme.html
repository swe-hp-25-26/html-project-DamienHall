                    <p>This project was created on 2/21/2025 and finished on 2/22/2025 by Damien Hall. I purposefully styled this to be exotic, bright, bold and crazy to fully embrace the "90's computer geek hacker vibe" aesthetic! Due to 90's aesthetic and general nuance to how websites were created back then, I have purposefully added some "off" characteristics to this site:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bright colors</li>
                        <li>Slightly mis-aligned yet aligned navigation bar</li>
                        <li>Bold blocky text</li>
                        <li>Unstyled text</li>
                        <li>Goofy-not-well-designed images</li>
                        <li>Abnormally large and pixelated cursor</li>
                        <li>Walls of text with no fancy fonts or spacing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While there is alot of stylistic liberty taken here, I have taken the 90's modern by adding some fancier CSS styling and JavaScript functionality to handle certain issues. The most notible styling and functionality choices are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Webpage uses %, em, vw and vh to create scaleability</li>
                        <li>When text on .txt files is too long for the view, it will be trimed with ...</li>
                        <li>Iframes were used to load "file-content" based on the .txt files on the side</li>
                        <li>Images only have max-width and max-height set for image scaleability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thanks for actually taking the time to read this! I put alot of effort into this website and I hope you like it! Now go on! Explore!</p>
